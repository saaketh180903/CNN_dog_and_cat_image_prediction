#Cat and Dog image Predictor

Trained a convolutional neural network(CNN) model to make these predictions
Trained the model on 8000 images and validated the results with 2000 images
Used tensorflow and keras for implementation

The model is giving an accuracy of 90% i.e, it will predict 9 out of 10 images correctly on an average

There are 7 layers in the model:
    1.Conv2D (Convolutional layer)
    2.MaxPool2D (Max Pooling layer)
    3.Conv2D (Convolutional layer)
    4.MaxPool2D (Max Pooling layer)
    5.Flatten (Flatten layer)
    6.Dense (Fully connected layer)
    7.Dense (Output layer)

Trained the model for 25 epochs
